                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>Stroganoff is a classic Russian dish that features a creamy sauce with beef and mushrooms served over wide egg noodles. Vegan Mushroom Stroganoff omits the beef, ups the mushrooms, and uses coconut milk for a version that is just as creamy and satisfying.</p>

                                onions are translucent.  Add the garlic and mushrooms, and sauté for 5 to 8 minutes, until the mushrooms are browned and tender. 
                                Stir in the thyme and sage, and cook for an additional minute until fragrant. </li>
